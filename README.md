# ICode Example

## Overview

This project is currently in the development phase and aims to deliver a comprehensive web application using React with Vite for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The project will involve the integration of multiple data storage solutions, including Redis and MongoDB, to support various features and functionalities. Additionally, we are using Tailwind CSS for styling and NextUI for enhanced React applications.

## Project Details

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and NextUI.
